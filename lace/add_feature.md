# Notes on adding features

- went to stats/prior/sbd.rs and added hyper
  - impl UpdatePrior
- Went to feature/column.rs and added to ColModel enum
- Went to lace_cc/src/traits.src and implemented
  - LacePrior
  - AccumScore
- Went to lace_cc/src/feature/component.rs and implemented
  - from_traits! to convert to Component enum
- Went to lace_data/src/datum.rs
  - Add Index Datum variant
  - impl all function in variant branch
- went to lace_stats/src/mixture_type.rs and implemented
  - StickBreakingDiscrete variant
  - need impl Entropy for Mixture<&StickBreakingDiscrete>
  - need impl Jsd for Mixture<&StickBreakingDiscrete>
  - impl_from!(StickBreakingDiscrete)
- went to lace_cc/src/feature/ftype.rs
  - added FType enum and all impls
- went to lace_codebook/src/codebook.rs
  - added StickBreakingDiscrete ColType
- back to column.rs
  - Qmc Entropy (Get rid of this)
- back to lace_cc/src/feature/traits.rs
  - add StickBreaking to use for enum dispatch
- went to feature/column.rs
  - impl_translate_datum!
- went to lace_data/src/feature.rs
  - Index variant in FeatureData & all impls
  - Summary statistic Enum Variant
- went to data_store.rs
  - DataStore.get match arm
- back to feature/ftype.rs
  - because FType, FeatureData, and Datum variant must all have the same name to work under the impl macro
- feature/geweke.rs
  - imple geweke traits, model, summary, sample
- state/builder.rs
  add match arm to gen_feature
- metadata/v1.rs
  - add variant to DatalessColModel
  - add match arm to From<ColModel> for DatalessColModel
  - col2dataless!
  - dataless2col!
- metadata/latest.rs
  - match arm on From<DatalessStateAndDiagnostics> for EmptyState
- went to src/data/init.rs
  - match arm in df_to_col_models NOTE: lots of repeateed code
- went to oracle/traits.rs
  - impute match arm (should be able to move to trait)
  - predict match arm
  - variability match arm (should be an method on MixtureType)
- went to lace_cc/tests/enum_test/mod.rs
  - Added feature ctor match arm
